<p class="ui header product-top-header" title=" Final Circuit Solution">For the circuit below, perform the following:

1.    Given an AC input voltage of Vrms = 200Vrms and a sinusoidal frequency of omega = 120pi rad/sec, determine the following:

o    V1peak (peak value of AC input voltage)

o    V1(peak-to-Vpeak )(peak to peak value of AC input voltage)

o    Frequency of input voltage V1 in Hz.

o    V2peak (peak value of AC output voltage)

o    V2(peak-to-Vpeak )(peak to peak value of AC output voltage)

o    Frequency of output voltage V2 in Hz.

2.    Construct circuit in MultiSIM using calculated values for V1.

3.    Capture a screenshot that shows V1 and V2 on an oscilloscope XSC1.
